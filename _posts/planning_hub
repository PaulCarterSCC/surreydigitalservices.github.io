In 2014 the Surrey GIS Forum submitted an application to the Technology Strategy Board for funding. We were awarded Â£25,000 to develop an online planning hub consisting of the following:
* All **decided** planning cases for the last 90 days
* All **undecided** planning cases

This we did.....check the results [here][planning_hub].
