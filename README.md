# surreydigitalservices.github.io

The [surreydigitalservices.github.io](http://surreydigitalservices.github.io) site is hosted on GitHub pages which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

When changes are made, it can take a few minutes before they are visible.

## Blog posts

Blog posts should be saved in the `_posts` directory and named with the following structure:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```
Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers.

The start of each post should contain [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) for example:

```
